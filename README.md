# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built with a modern, single-page design inspired by Gentle Monster.

## Features

-   **Single-Page Layout**: A smooth, scrolling experience across different sections (About, Projects, Experience, Contact).
-   **Immersive Landing Page**: Features a full-screen video background.
-   **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes for a consistent experience on desktop and mobile.
-   **Custom Fonts**: Utilizes modern web fonts for a clean aesthetic.

## Deployment

This site is automatically deployed using GitHub Pages. Any push to the `main` branch will trigger a new deployment, which will be live at [https://shafeiw.github.io/](https://shafeiw.github.io/).
